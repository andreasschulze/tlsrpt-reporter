== Name

tlsrpt-reporter - A daemon to create and deliver TLSRPT reports according to RFC 8460.

== Synopsis

*tlsrpt-reporter* [_OPTION_]

== Description
The tlsrpt-reporter is the final component in the TLSRPT framework.
A MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) reports successful delivery or encountered errors via libtlsrpt to a tlsrpt-receiver which collects and pre-aggregates the data.
The tlsrpt-fetcher associated with a tlsrpt-receiver transfers the pre-aggregated data to the tlsrpt-reporter.
The tlsrpt-reporter can retrieve data from multiple tlsrpt-fetchers and aggregates the pre-aggregated data into the final reports.
Those reports are gzip-compressed and sent out to the destinations as specified in the TLSRPT DNS records of the domains that have received emails from the MTA.

A simple data flow diagram visualizing the interaction of the components looks like this:

== Options

=== Report creation and configuration options

*--contact_info*=_addr_::
Use _addr_ as contact info in the TLSRPT report according to RFC 8460.

*--organization_name*=_descr_::
Use _descr_ as name of the organization sending the TLSRPT report according to RFC 8460. 

*--sender_address*=_email_::
Use _email_ as "From:" address when sending reports via email.

*--fetchers*=_list_::
List of fetcher commands to retrieve data.
Multiple fetcher commands can be given separated by commas.

*--dbname*=_path_::
Use SQLite data base at location _path_.

*--compression_level*=_n_::
Use compression level _n_ to gzip-compress the TLSRPT reports.

*--keep_days*=_n_::
Keep old data for _n_ days before deleting from the database. 

=== Report delivery options

*--spread_out_delivery*=_sec_::
Spread out the delivery of TLSRPT reports over _sec_ seconds.
This setting should be set to several hours according to RFC8460, section 4.1.
For example, set spread_out_delivery to 14400 to spread out the delivery of the reports over four hours.

*--sendmail_script*=_path_::
Use the script _path_ to send a TLSRPT report via email.

*--sendmail_timeout*=_sec_::
Set timeout of _sec_ seconds for email requests to deliver reports.

*--http_timeout*=_sec_::
Set timeout of _sec_ seconds for HTTP POST requests to deliver reports.

*--max_retries_delivery*=_n_::
Give up after _n_ failed attempts to deliver a report to its destination.


*--min_wait_delivery*=_sec_::
Minimum time to wait before retrying a failed report delivery attempt.

*--max_wait_delivery*=_sec_::
Maximum time to wait before retrying a failed report delivery attempt.


=== Options controlling the interaction with tlsrpt-receivers

*--max_receiver_timediff*=_sec_::
Log a warning if the receiver clock reported by its fetcher differs by more than _sec_ seconds from the reporterÂ´s clock.
The reporter starts querying the fetchers _sec_ seconds after the UTC day change, so a clock difference bigger than _sec_ seconds indicates the receiver might not yet been ready to provide the complete data for the previous day.

*--max_receiver_timeout*=_sec_::
Wait at most _sec_ seconds for a fetcher to finish a request for data from its receiver.


*--max_retries_domaindetails*=_n_::
Give up after _n_ failed attempts to retrieve report details for a domain.

*--min_wait_domaindetails*=_sec_::
Minimum time to wait before retry after a failed attempt to get the report details for a domain from a tlsrpt-receiver.

*--max_wait_domaindetails*=_sec_::
Maximum time to wait before retry after a failed attempt to get the report details for a domain from a tlsrpt-receiver.


*--max_retries_domainlist*=_n_:: 
Give up after _n_ failed attempts to retrieve the list of domains from a tlsrpt-receiver. 

*--min_wait_domainlist*=_sec_::
Minimum time to wait before retry after a failed attempt to get the list of domains from a tlsrpt-receiver.

*--max_wait_domainlist*=_sec_::
Maximum time to wait before retry after a failed attempt to get the list of domains from a tlsrpt-receiver.


*--interval_main_loop*=_sec_::
Wake up an idle main loop even if there are no tasks after _sec_ seconds of inactivity.


=== Debug and development options

*--debug_db*=_n_::
Control database debugging: 0 turns database debugging off, 1 activates logging of database statements.

*--debug_send_file_dest*=_dir_::
Save reports into directory _dir_ in addition to their delivery via email or HTTP POST requests.

*--debug_send_mail_dest*=_path_::
Override the email destination to send out reports via email.
Please note: With this option set, reports to email destinations will not be sent ot the requested destination from the TLSRPT DNS record but to this replacement address instead!
{production-warning}  

*--debug_send_http_dest*=_path_::
Override the HTTP POST destination to send out reports via HTTP POST requests.
Please note: With this option set, reports to HTTP POST destinations will not be sent ot the requested destination from the TLSRPT DNS record but to this replacement URL instead!
