# libtlsrpt

libtlsrpt is a low-level C Library. It provides functions that help generate
TLSRPT datagrams. Included into a MTA it assists the MTA in collecting and
sending these datagrams to a TLSRPT reporting service where they can be
collected, summarized and finally sent to a mail platform that requests TLSRPT
reports.

The Library has been released under [GNU Lesser General Public License
(LGPL)](COPYING.LESSER) on purpose. We want to foster adoption of TLSRPT.
Please feel free to use it. If you have any questions regarding the project
we'd like to ask you to either start a discussion or create an issue on GitHub.
Instructions on how to build and install libtlsrpt are located in
[INSTALL](INSTALL).
