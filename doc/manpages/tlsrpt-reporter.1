.SH "NAME"
tlsrpt\-reporter \- A daemon to create and deliver TLSRPT reports according to RFC 8460.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBtlsrpt\-fetcher\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The tlsrpt\-reporter is the final component in the TLSRPT framework.
A MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) reports successful delivery or encountered errors via libtlsrpt to a tlsrpt\-receiver which collects and pre\-aggregates the data.
The tlsrpt\-fetcher associated with a tlsrpt\-receiver transfers the pre\-aggregated data to the tlsrpt\-reporter.
The tlsrpt\-reporter can retrieve data from multiple tlsrpt\-fetchers and aggregates the pre\-aggregated data into the final reports.
Those reports are gzip\-compressed and sent out to the destinations as specified in the TLSRPT DNS records of the domains that have received emails from the MTA.
.sp
A simple data flow diagram visualizing the interaction of the components looks like this:

List of fetcher commands to retrieve data.
Multiple fetcher commands can be given separated by commas.

.sp
\fB\-\-spread_out_delivery\fP=\fIsec\fP
.RS 4
Spread out the delivery of TLSRPT reports over \fIsec\fP seconds.
This setting should be set to several hours according to RFC8460, section 4.1.
For example, set spread_out_delivery to 14400 to spread out the delivery of the reports over four hours.

.SS "Options controlling the interaction with tlsrpt\-receivers"
.sp
\fB\-\-max_receiver_timediff\fP=\fIsec\fP
.RS 4
Log a warning if the receiver clock reported by its fetcher differs by more than \fIsec\fP seconds from the reporterÂ´s clock.
The reporter starts querying the fetchers \fIsec\fP seconds after the UTC day change, so a clock difference bigger than \fIsec\fP seconds indicates the receiver might not yet been ready to provide the complete data for the previous day.
.RE

Control development mode: 0 turns development mode off, 1 activates development mode.
In development mode the reporter behaves very different and might send out reports incomplete reports too early or might not send out reports at all!
This option must not be used on production systems!
